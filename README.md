# LinkedDataElements
Omeka plugin.  Adds a URI field alongside Element Text, to be populated from authoritative lookup.

This hijacks some core files by loading the plugin's copies of them first.  Ultimately we'd like to push this upstream.

Upgrade carefully with this one since the plugin version must be in sync with core.  You can manually patch these using diff to view any changes, if needed.
